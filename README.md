- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tanoss00
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, coding, anime, gaming, ecc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, and studying Industrial Engineering at the University of Trento.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on programming and learning new things in general.
- 📫 You can reach me on my personal email "tanossmhamud00@gmail.com"
- I currently live in Italy and my wish is to travel the world eventually. I don't know a lot of things, just a few superficial information about certain arguments.
- Always open to learn.
